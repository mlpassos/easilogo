EASiLOGO stands for Etch-A-Sketch Interactive LOGO and puns on the idea that it's a LOGO that is EASY. :)

The hardware will be demoed live at the McAllen Mini Maker Faire this coming Saturday.

This was originally a project for the Maker Faire but if we see the interest that we hope to see, there's a good chance we'll go on to turn it into something long term.

The underlying LOGO engine is straight out of the javascript browser-based Papert LOGO.  The project is all about the user interface, so we won't be changing the underlying LOGO much at all (except to remove commands that an Etch-A-Sketch can't implement, such as PEN UP or COLOR).

We're aware of a few things that could be added to the interface but we've made an executive decision to freeze it completely until the live demo on Saturday.  After that, we'll make any improvements from feedback and our growing wish list.  But the overall design goal is elegance and simplicity - this has to be intuitive to use by 10 year olds... (and 55 year olds)
